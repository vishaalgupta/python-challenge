# PyBank
# I calculated the total months in the dataset and then calculated the total Profit/Loss for each month
# I calculated the difference in Profit/Loss for each month compared to the previous month and stored each difference in a list
# I took the average of each of those differences and then determined the minimum/maximum difference
#
# PyPoll
# I calculated the total number of votes that were cast
# I outputed information on each candidate who received a vote, including their name, percent of total votes they received, and the actual number of votes they received
# Based on the number of votes each candidate received, I was able to determine who won the popular vote
