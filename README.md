#PyBank
#I calculated the total months in the dataset and then calculated the total Profit/Loss for each month
#I calculated the difference in Profit/Loss for each month and the previous month and stored those in a list
#I took the average of each of those differences and determined the minimum/maximum difference
#
#PyPoll
#I calculated the total number of votes that were cast
#I outputed information on each candidate who received a vote, including their name, percent of total votes they received, and the actual number of votes they received
#Based on the number of votes each candidate received, I was able to determine who won the popular vote
